    <h1>Web Designing</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed. </p>
    <h4>What Do Web Designers Do?</h4>
    <p>
     Web designers create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.

    <h4>Web Design Vs. Web Development</h4>
    <p> Web design and web development are two terms that are often used interchangeably. However, they both mean two different things, have different purposes, and require a different set of skills to be implemented on a website. Web design is more about the experiential side of a website that ensures the audience finds the website useful, immersive, and engaging. It is highly intuitive based on the expectations of the users and uses this knowledge of user expectations to ensure an excellent user experience. Web development, on the other hand, involves building and maintaining a website with the help of coding systems so that the website functions smoothly with no glitches.</p>
