    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps. Think of all the web pages you have used over the years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.</p>

    <h4>What Does a Web Developer Do?</h4>
    <p>
        Web developers develop websites, specifically by creating the site’s code, connecting it to a server and maintaining its accessibility to users.

        Web development is responsible for creating the sites and applications we use through a web browser in our day-to-day lives. Web developers, often working in teams or alongside other tech professionals like data scientists, UX designers and product managers, use specialized techniques and a thorough knowledge of one or more programming languages to create a foundation for where the website’s database will live, known as a back-end. 
        
        The back-end is dependent upon the website’s server, which stores web pages and applications to be loaded into the web browser upon request.  The server acts as an intermediary between the web page or application and the data stored within the server, facilitating communication between the database and the client.
        
        Web developers are also responsible for creating the front-end of a website through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which creates the layout and style that the user sees and interacts with when using the site.

    <h4>Types of Web Development</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Front-end development</li>
        <li>Back-end development</li>
        <li>Full-stack development</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Web Design Vs. Web Development</h4>
    <p> Web design and web development are two terms that are often used interchangeably. However, they both mean two different things, have different purposes, and require a different set of skills to be implemented on a website. Web design is more about the experiential side of a website that ensures the audience finds the website useful, immersive, and engaging. It is highly intuitive based on the expectations of the users and uses this knowledge of user expectations to ensure an excellent user experience. Web development, on the other hand, involves building and maintaining a website with the help of coding systems so that the website functions smoothly with no glitches.</p>
